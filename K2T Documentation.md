# Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service

In April’19, it was [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-kaizala-blog/microsoft-kaizala-rolls-out-to-office-365-customers-globally-and/ba-p/394298) that Microsoft Kaizala capabilities will be integrated into Teams and the customers would need to eventually transition to Microsoft Teams. As a part of this customer promise, Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service was built as a part of the customer promise to help them convert their custom Kaizala actions to Teams with minimal costs.

Using Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service, customers can  convert their existing custom apps from Kaizala to Teams in minimal steps and at no additional investment from their end. This service can be used by tenant admins, developers, and business admins alike. Depending on the kind of access you have you can follow one of the following two processes:

1.  **Using Kaizala Management Portal:** If you have access to Kaizala Management Portal, then use ‘Move to Teams’ feature added to app detail info page to convert your Kaizala Action to a Teams app. 
    
2.  **Using Windows Command Line tool:** If you have a Kaizala Action Package file and need it converted to Teams app, then you can use the command line tool available on Windows for conversion process.
    
Once the Teams app file is downloaded, the next step is to add it to Teams either through the Teams Admin Portal, or by sideloading it from Teams desktop or web client. Make sure you have access to AAD account of the tenant you want to migrate the app to and have permission to access Teams Admin Portal or can sideload the app from Teams client.

## FAQs

**What data is captured in Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service and how it is used?**

Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service requires user to upload custom Kaizala action package to it and requires user to login with AAD account. Once uploaded, Conversion service converts action package to Teams app using AAD account for authentication. 
Additionally, user also needs to provide necessary developer information like website, Privacy URL, and Terms of use URL, to be used for creating Teams app file.  

Once the converted Teams app is downloaded, the uploaded Kaizala Action package is deleted from conversion service.  

**Which Kaizala actions can be converted to Teams Apps using Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service?**

Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service supports conversion of all custom actions built using Kaizala Action Designer, which includes Survey, Checklist, Announcements, etc. 

**Will data also be migrated to Teams with actions?  Will it impact existing action being used in Kaizala?**

Kaizala to Teams Conversion Service only converts Kaizala Actions to Teams Apps and does not migrate any data or users to Teams. Moreover, the conversion has no impact on existing action being used in Kaizala. The converted action will behave as an independent app in Teams and the data will be collected afresh. 


**Why is conversion failing?**

There can be multiple reasons why app conversion could fail. Some of the known reasons along with their mitigation is shared below: 

- Kaizala actions could have app icons in different formats like .jpg, but Teams only accept PNG format as a valid app icon file throwing error in other cases. To mitigate this issue, update the icon to PNG before converting Kaizala Action to Teams app. 

- Kaizala actions can have long title, but length of Teams actions’ title can be only 32 characters. To mitigate this issue trim Kaizala action’s title to 32 characters before converting the package to Teams. 


**Which features might not work in the converted Teams app?** 

Conversion of action-designer based cards will be supported on KMP. Meaning, custom action cards will not be convertible. Even within the supported ‘Action-designer based cards’ some features might not work due to reasons such as corresponding API not available on Teams Platform, or capability not supported in Kaizala actions. Describing the same below: 

 
Capabilities not supported in converted Teams app: 

- Send reminder 
- Duplicate a survey 
- Upload image from camera 
- Preview current location’s address and map image 
- Survey Action on Teams Desktop will not work if sharing current location is set to mandatory. This happens because required HTML5 API is not supported on Teams desktop client.
